The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!

Connect to the program with netcat:

`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 55826`

The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/536/program-redacted.c).

This was a really easy challenge to solve. After connecting to the server you're provide with the following choices:

`Hi, welcome to my echo chamber!`

`Type '1' to enter a phrase into our database`

`Type '2' to echo a phrase in our database`

`Type '3' to exit the program`

We can either analyze the source code of the program to see what we gotta do or just do it by trial and error. Any way you solve 
it, it was a very easy challenge.
