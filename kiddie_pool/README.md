We have been provided a file named kiddie_pool.png.After looking at the extension we see that it's a `png` file, so we decide to open it in gimp.

```
gimp kiddie_pool.png
```
After analyzing a little bit we see that the flag is in there, but it's distorsioned.After searching on the internet we see that we need to use the whirl and pinch tool to get the flag.
In the end, after playing for a while with the tool wee manage to get the flag.

```
flag{whirlpool_in_a_cinch}
```
This wasn't a hard challenge at all as it was fun:D.
